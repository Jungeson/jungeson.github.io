**Abstract:** The complicated nanoporous structure and significant heterogeneity of shale matrix make it challenging to fully understand the gas transport behavior in shale. Towards this end, herein a multiscale approach was presented via coupling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, analytical model and pore network model (PNM). Using MD simulations, we showed that gas transport in organic nanopores manifests a typical slippage feature whereas gas slippage breaks down in inorganic nanopores, which should be attributed to “rough” potential energy surface (PES) of inorganic walls. Based on the results of MD simulations, a unified gas transport model was derived to describe gas flow behaviors in organic and inorganic pores by integrating continuum flow theory and gas-surface dynamics theory. In particular, gas transport process in heterogeneous shale matrix was performed with the help of pore network model and the influence of multiple factors on the gas permeability of shale matrix were analysed and discussed.
